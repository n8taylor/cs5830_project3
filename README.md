# Data Analysis Project 3
#### Pokemon Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves using multiple analysis techniques to explore Pokemon data. The dataset contains information on Pokemon species, types, and stats.

## Dataset Description
The dataset

## File Structure
- `project3.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for this project.
- `Pokemon.csv`: Dataset containing Pokemon names, types, and stats.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install Python (version 3.x or above) and Jupyter Notebooks.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python packages.

## Usage
- Open the `project3.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS code to view the analysis.
- The notebook is divided into sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the data analysis.
- You can modify and rerun the code cells to explore different hypotheses or perspectives.

## Analysis Techniques 
1. Pearson correlations
2. Scatterplots
3. Averages
4. Standard deviations
5. T-tests (or Mann-Whitney-U test)
