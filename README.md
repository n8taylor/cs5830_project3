# Data Analysis Project 3
#### Pokemon Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves using multiple analysis techniques to explore Pokemon data. The dataset contains information on Pokemon species, types, and stats.

## Dataset Description
We utilized the PokeAPI dataset for our analysis as well as a compiled dataset by [Igreski](https://github.com/lgreski/pokemonData/blob/master/Pokemon.csv). This was due to the PokeAPI being relatively slow to pull from. The data is static, and the compoiled dataset has each Pokemon with their respective ID, Name, Types, Generation and stats.

## File Structure
- `project3.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for this project.
- `Pokemon.csv`: Dataset containing Pokemon names, types, and stats.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install Python (version 3.x or above) and Jupyter Notebooks.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python packages.

## Usage
- Open the `project3.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS code to view the analysis.
- The notebook is divided into sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the data analysis.
- You can modify and rerun the code cells to explore different hypotheses or perspectives.

## Analysis Techniques 
1. Pearson correlations
2. Scatterplots
3. Averages
4. Standard deviations
5. T-tests (or Mann-Whitney-U test)
