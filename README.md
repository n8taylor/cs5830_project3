# Data Analysis Project 3
#### Pokemon Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves using multiple analysis techniques to explore Pokemon data. The dataset contains information on Pokemon species, types, moves and stats.

## Dataset Description
We utilized the PokeAPI dataset for our analysis. The data is up to date with the latest official values from the games. This API also includes data on other Pokemon related entities beyond the creatures: Berries, Contests, Encounters, Evolution, Games, Items, Locations, Machines, and Moves. This is a very powerful comprehensive dataset that allows for analysis of any Pokemon-associated data that one could imagine. 

## File Structure
- `project3.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for this project.
- `Project 3 Report.pdf`: A report containing the analysis findings and conclusions.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install Python (version 3.x or above) and Jupyter Notebooks.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python packages.

## Usage
- Open the `project3.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS code to view the analysis.
- The notebook is divided into sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the data analysis.
- You can modify and rerun the code cells to explore different hypotheses or perspectives.

## Analysis Techniques 
<!-- 1. Pearson correlations
2. Scatterplots
3. Averages
4. Standard deviations
5. T-tests (or Mann-Whitney-U test) -->
